# CloudBees Credentials plugin

This plugin extends [Credentials Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/credentials/) and
allow Jenkins to store your [CloudBees](http://www.cloudbees.com/)
account information and its password. This is normally not a plugin that
you'll choose to install on its own. Rather, it gets installed as a
dependency of other plugins.
